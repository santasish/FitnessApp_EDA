Welcome to the Fitness App Data EDA project! In a world increasingly focused on health and wellness, the importance of tracking fitness data cannot be overstated. This project was inspired by the realization that data analytics can significantly contribute to improving personal fitness journeys. By examining various fitness parameters over time, we gain valuable insights into our exercise routines, efficiency, and overall well-being.

### Project Overview
In this exploratory data analysis project, we employed Python and its powerful libraries, including Pandas for data manipulation and Plotly for dynamic visualizations, to delve into a wealth of fitness data. We examined multiple fitness metrics, providing a comprehensive view of fitness trends and patterns. The project covered the following aspects:


### EDA 
###### Step Count Over Time: 
Visualizing step count trends to understand daily activity levels.
